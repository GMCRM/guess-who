    <h2>Game Rules: Guess the Character!</h2>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The goal of the game is for one team to guess the mystery character, which is displayed on the right side of the screen, by asking yes/no questions. The other team will answer the questions, and the asking team will use the answers to eliminate characters from the grid. The team that correctly guesses the mystery character first wins the round.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Play:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team will be provided with a grid of 20 character cards. Each card shows an image of a character and their name.</li>
          <li>One Mystery Card will be displayed on the right side of the screen. This card shows the image and name of the mystery character, which the opposing team will try to guess.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Asking Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The team whose turn it is will ask yes/no questions about the mystery card to the opposing team.</li>
          <li>Example questions could be:
            <ul>
              <li>“Does the mystery card show a person with feet showing?”</li>
              <li>“Is the mystery card an item?”</li>
              <li>“Does the character have a sword in the image?”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The team who is answering the questions will respond with “Yes” or “No”.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Eliminating Cards:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>After each question, the team asking the questions will use the answer to eliminate certain cards from the grid that they no longer think could be the mystery character.</li>
          <li>For example, if the answer is “No, the mystery character doesn’t have feet showing,” then the team can flip over any cards that do have feet showing, as they are not the mystery character.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Making a Guess:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Once a team feels confident that they know which character on the grid matches the mystery card, they can make a guess.</li>
          <li>If they guess correctly, they win the round.</li>
          <li>If they guess incorrectly, they continue asking questions and eliminating cards until they are confident again.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Winning the Round:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The round is won when the team guesses the mystery character correctly.</li>
          <li>After each round, the roles are switched: the team who was answering the questions will now ask questions about a new mystery character displayed on the right.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Additional Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Peeking:</strong> The team asking the questions cannot see the mystery card. They must rely on the answers provided by the opposing team to guide their guesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Only Yes/No Questions:</strong> The questions must be answerable with only “Yes” or “No.” Open-ended questions are not allowed.</li>
      <li><strong>Elimination Process:</strong> Once a question is asked and answered, cards that don’t fit the criteria should be flipped over to eliminate them from consideration.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Questioning:</strong> Ask questions that will help eliminate a large portion of the grid. For example, questions about specific characteristics (e.g., “Does the character have a crown?”) will help narrow down possibilities more quickly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Winning the Game:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The game is played in multiple rounds. After each round, the teams swap roles (the guessing team becomes the asking team).</li>
      <li><strong>No Repeating Questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>To keep the game fresh and exciting, no question can be repeated during the game. Once a question has been asked, it’s off-limits for the rest of the round.</li>
          <li>This encourages players to think creatively and ask unique, insightful questions. It also ensures that the game doesn’t get repetitive and keeps everyone on their toes!</li>
          <li>If a player accidentally repeats a question, they must skip their turn and the opposing team gets to ask an additional question.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Question Bank:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Players can create a mental “question bank” by coming up with their own unique ways of asking about characteristics like colors, shapes, specific objects, or features that make each card unique.</li>
          <li>Players can even throw in some fun, creative questions like: “Is the character in a heroic pose?” or “Does this character look like they’re from a fantasy movie?”</li>
          <li>The team that asks the most creative and strategic questions will gain the upper hand as they narrow down the options.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The first team to guess the mystery character correctly in three rounds wins the game.</li>
    </ul>
